# Portfolio Testing Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive testing checklist for the portfolio website to ensure all requirements are met across different devices and browsers.

## Automated Testing

### Running Automated Tests

#### Method 1: Comprehensive Test Script (Recommended)
1. Open the portfolio website in your browser
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. Go to the Console tab
4. Load and run the comprehensive test script:
   ```javascript
   // Load the comprehensive testing script
   const script = document.createElement('script');
   script.src = './test-portfolio.js';
   document.head.appendChild(script);
   ```

#### Method 2: Individual Test Modules
Run individual test suites for specific testing:

```javascript
// Comprehensive tests with all modules
import('./src/utils/testRunner.js').then(module => {
  module.runTestsWithFeedback();
});

// Cross-browser and mobile tests only
import('./src/utils/crossBrowserTest.js').then(module => {
  const results = module.runAllTests();
  module.logTestResults(results);
});

// Accessibility tests only
import('./src/utils/accessibilityTest.js').then(module => {
  const results = module.runAccessibilityTests();
  module.logAccessibilityResults(results);
});

// Mobile optimization tests only
import('./src/utils/mobileOptimization.js').then(module => {
  const results = module.runMobileOptimization();
  module.logMobileOptimizationResults(results);
});
```

#### Method 3: Quick Requirements Testing
For testing specific portfolio requirements:
```javascript
// Test all requirements
testPortfolioRequirements();

// Test individual requirements
testRequirement1(); // Professional background
testRequirement2(); // Technical skills
testRequirement3(); // Projects showcase
testRequirement4(); // Contact functionality
testRequirement5(); // Responsive design
testRequirement6(); // Performance
```
